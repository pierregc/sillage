# Working notes

Read `README.md` for what the project is and how it works. This file is only the things a
fresh session cannot deduce from the code.

## This machine

**Xcode is not installed**, only the Command Line Tools. Two consequences:

- Metal shaders are compiled at runtime through `MTLDevice.makeLibrary(source:)`, so a syntax
  error in MSL only shows up when a pipeline is first built. `allShadersCompile` and
  `allBarnesHutShadersCompile` in the tests exist to force that early. There is no GPU frame
  debugger and no Metal shader profiler.
- **SwiftPM is broken**: the CLT ship a `PackageDescription` whose interface and dylib
  disagree, so every manifest fails to compile, including the one `swift package init`
  generates. `Package.swift` is kept correct for CI, which runs on a GitHub macOS runner where
  Xcode is present, but locally everything goes through `scripts/dev.sh`:

```
./scripts/dev.sh test     # builds and runs the whole suite through swiftc
./scripts/dev.sh lint     # swift-format, strict
./scripts/dev.sh render   # the headless renderer, takes the CLI flags
./scripts/dev.sh app      # builds and bundles Sillage.app
```

**Screen recording is not granted**, so `screencapture` fails and the app window cannot be
looked at directly. Six modes replace it, and they are the only way to verify the app:

```
Sillage.app --selftest    # model, solver, renderer and preview offscreen; writes out/selftest.png
Sillage.app --verify      # opens the window and drives the view, reports frames drawn
Sillage.app --uishot      # renders the panels through ImageRenderer to out/
Sillage.app --presets     # cycles the setup presets with the window up
Sillage.app --responsive  # runs a self-gravitating scene, reports how long the main actor stalls
Sillage.app --qa          # walks the whole run flow and reports every check
```

`--qa` is the one to run after touching anything in the app: it sets up a scene, launches it,
watches it capture, pauses it, stops it, replays it, scrubs it, picks it back up, starts over,
fills the memory budget, and does the last of it again on the self-gravitating solver.

`--presets` is the only mode that catches a stale index in the galaxy list: `--uishot` builds
the view tree once and never updates it, so a card that crashes on the *change* of a preset
renders perfectly there.

`--verify` drives the canvas itself rather than waiting on the display link, because a window
opened behind another application counts as occluded and MTKView parks its display link. A
report of zero frames means occlusion, not a regression.

## Conventions

- Conventional commits, small, minimal `-m`. **No `Co-authored-by` trailer.**
- Comments are sparse and explain why, never what.
- **Never push and never create the GitHub repository without explicit approval.** Nothing has
  been pushed. The repo does not exist on GitHub yet, and neither do the milestones.

## Habits worth keeping

- Render previews small when the point is to judge a look. A 900 px image answers the question
  a 5000 px contact sheet answers, at a fraction of the context.
- Prefer targeted edits over rewriting whole files: rewriting through a shell heredoc makes the
  harness echo the entire file back as a diff.
- Editing the MSL strings by pattern is fragile because the formatter reindents them. Match on
  distinctive lines without assuming leading whitespace, and always assert the pattern was
  found; a silent no-op replacement has cost hours here.

## State and known limitations

Both solvers work. Level 1 is tracers in rigid potentials, level 2 is self-gravitating
Barnes-Hut with live halos, and level 2 is the default. Galaxies merge, and the orbital decay
is measured in the README.

Standing gaps, in the order they matter:

1. **No gas.** HII regions are decorative: placed by the sampler, not produced by collapse.
   No shocks, no starbursts in the right places, no dust distribution from physics. Adding SPH
   is a project of its own and would cost another order of magnitude in speed.
2. **Colour is not derived.** Stellar populations are a hand-made ramp rather than luminosities
   in real bands composited like telescope filters. This is the next lever for making the
   interior of a galaxy legible.
3. **Disk stability, now measured and mostly fixed.** An isolated self-gravitating disk used
   to spread its mean radius by 23 % over the first 40 Myr, identically at every time step
   from a quarter of the tuned one to eight times it: the initial conditions, not the
   integrator. The sampler took its rotation curve from the analytic potential the galaxy is
   written as, while laying the mass down as a flattened exponential disk, a bulge and a
   truncated halo, none of which pull like that sphere. The disk came out turning at 0.81 of
   what the real field asks. The curve is now built from the components themselves, Freeman's
   Bessel form included, and the halo's dispersion is solved against the same composite.
   Drift over 40 Myr: 23 % to 2 % with a live halo, 11 % to 0.3 % without. `aSelfGravitatingDiskHoldsItsRadius`
   guards it. What is still unmeasured is what happens over many orbits rather than half of one.

   The tuned step itself is roughly sixteen times more conservative than it needs to be. Up to
   16x the radial profile after 40 Myr stays within 0.3 % of a reference run at a quarter of
   it, 32x is within 1 %, 64x within 3 %, and 128x visibly wrong. A 100 Myr self-gravitating
   merger at 200 k particles renders indistinguishably at 16x, in 5.8 s against 92 s. Hence
   `timeStepScale`, which is that multiplier; the default stays 1 because a close encounter
   reaches speeds an isolated disk does not.
4. **Force traversal is where the time goes.** Measured on an M4 Max at 400 k visible
   particles with live halos, so a million simulated: 95 ms a step, of which 76 ms is
   `bhAcceleration` and 18 ms the CPU tree build. Sharing one stack across a SIMD group is
   still the remaining large win.

   Do not reach for the obvious shortcut: shrinking the per-thread `int stack[64]` looks like
   a 4x speed-up on the clock and is worthless. At 16 entries the traversal silently drops
   the children it cannot push, and `accelerationMatchesDirectSummation` goes from 2 % mean
   error to 34 %. That the timing moves that much for a change in stack size alone is still
   worth knowing: the cost is thread-private storage as much as it is divergence.

   The bulge costs 13 % of a step, all of it in traversal: 98.6 ms against 111.3 ms at 400 k
   visible particles. Concentrating a seventh of the stars into half a kiloparsec deepens the
   tree exactly where the lanes of a SIMD group have to walk it.
5. **Graininess in the outskirts** comes from the clumpiness of the initial conditions, not
   from sampling. It is deliberate, but it reads as noise now that the render is sharp.
